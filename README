# zxfs (zero x file system) #
#############################

Well, intention for adding another file system is not to create
next 'great' file system or to solve any perticular problem or
to save the world etc.

This project is intended to be a handsi-on guide/aide for people
who want to learn Linux file system witout burden of lifting heavy
books and ninja style code.So, aim is to be simple, informative
and complete (should cover all aspects of FS development).

If you have comments or need help dont hesitate to drop a mail to
me at cg011235@gmail.com
